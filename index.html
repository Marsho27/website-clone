<br>
<p>Hellooo, friend! I hope you had a lovely holiday weekend and you‚Äôre staying warm and safe<br/>wherever you‚Äôre reading from today.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, we introduced a new mini-series of blog posts - <u>Small Change, Big Impact.</u></p>
<p>The last post of every month, we focused on just one small thing we can do in our <br/> everyday lives that actually has a pretty big impact for our planet, especially when we <br/>consider the impact we have as a collective.</p>

<p>We covered 11 different ways to reduce our footprint, and to wrap up this little mini-series of <br/> ours, I wanted to take a little journey back through each of them and see just how big of an <br/> impact we could really have if we made these changes for just one month.</p>

<p>So grab a peppermint mocha, your coziest of blankets, and let‚Äôs do this thing.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Unsubscribe from Emails</h2>

<p>In January, we covered what was probably my favorite change of all - <u>unsubscribing from unwanted emails</u></p>
<p>For the typical email user, one year of email produces about 135kg of carbon dioxide. <br/> That‚Äôs about the same as driving 200 miles in an average car üò≥ Just from our emails!</p>
<p>And interestingly, most of that energy comes from opening, reading, and deleting the <br/> emails - not much is from the actual sending of the emails</p>
<p>Since your inbox probably looks very different from mine, it‚Äôs more difficult to determine energy <br/> saved per email, so let‚Äôs say we can cut back our emails by 10% - by unsubscribing from <br/> unwanted promotional emails, avoiding sending emails that just say ‚Äúthanks‚Äù, and not cc‚Äôing our <br/> entire department on an email just in case, in one month, we‚Äôll save 13.5kg of <br/> carbon dioxide - or the equivalent of not driving 20 miles.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Switch to a Low-Flow Shower Head</h2>

<p>In February, we flipped the script on the ‚Äú5 minute shower‚Äù idea, because, really, who can <br/> actually take a full shower in five minutes??</p>

<p>Instead, <u>switching to an EPA-approved low-flow shower head</u> can save the average family about <br/> 2,700 gallons of water and 330 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity every year.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs the same amount of emissions as driving 588 miles!</p>
<p>By making the switch to a low-flow shower head, in one month, we‚Äôll save 225 gallons of water <br/> and 27.5 kWh of electricity - the equivalent of not driving 49 miles in an average car.</p>

<br>

<br>
<h2>Wash Your Laundry on Cold</h2>
<p>In March, we dug into three reasons we should <u> wash our laundry on cold,</u> and found that if we <br/> wash just one load of laundry each week on the cold setting, we can save as many greenhouse <br/> gases as not driving 77 miles - just from one load.</p>
<p>Over the course of one month, with just one load of laundry a week on cold, we‚Äôll each basically <br/> take a car off the road for a full 308 miles. </p>
<br>

<h2>Hang Dry Your Laundry</h2>

<P>In April, keeping with the laundry theme, we moved over to the dryer, and found that an average <br/> clothes dryer uses about 2.79 kilowatts of electricity per hour.</P>
<p>These emissions are about the same as driving five miles in an average car, and if the average <br/> family runs their dryer about six hours every week, that means that in one week, each dryer is <br/> creating the same emissions as driving about 30 miles.</p>
<p>Over the course of a month, if we instead <u>choose to hang dry our laundry,</u>  <br/> we‚Äôll save the same emissions as not driving 120 miles.</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2>Use Your Dishwasher</h2>

<p>In May, we moved into the kitchen with <u> three reasons we should use our dishwashers </u> <br/> instead of washing by hand.</p>
<p>Personally, I was shocked to discover that washing dishes by hand just every other day uses <br/> creates about 1,601 pounds of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of driving 1,826 miles in one year.</p>
<p>But using an Energy Star certified dishwasher cuts those numbers down to just 422 pounds of <br/> carbon dioxide, or 481 miles of driving.</p>
<p>That means in just one month, washing dishes every other day in our dishwasher rather than by <br/> hand, we‚Äôll cut our carbon dioxide emissions by 98.25 pounds of carbon, or essentially take <br/> a car off the road for 112 miles.</p>
<br>

<h2>Turn off Heated Dry</h2>

<p>In June, keeping with the dishwasher theme, we took an even closer look at how we can use our <br/> dishwashers most efficiently, and found that <u>turning off heated dry</u> will save a full 11% of <br/> emissions associated with washing your dishes.</p>
<p>Over the course of the dishwasher‚Äôs ten-year average lifetime, that‚Äôs about 800 miles not driven, <br/> meaning in just one month, by turning off the heated dry function, we‚Äôll save the same <br/> emissions as not driving 6.7 miles!</p>
<hr>
<p><b>So let‚Äôs pause for a second.</b> Halfway through 2021‚Äôs Small Change, Big Impact and by making <br/> these changes for just one month, we‚Äôve basically avoided driving 615.7 miles. That‚Äôs like not <br/> taking a road trip from Denver to Kansas City. And we‚Äôre only halfway through the year‚Ä¶</p>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Skip Preheating the Oven</h2>
<p>Moving forward‚Ä¶ In July, we moved from the dishwasher to the oven, and asked if <u>preheating our <br/> oven is really necessary.</u></p>
<p>Overall, the answer was no, it‚Äôs not necessary to preheat the oven.</p>
<p>There were some exceptions, especially with baking, but for the most part, <br/> it‚Äôs just not a requirement.</p>
<p>One study even showed that not preheating could save up to 10% of the energy used for cooking <br/> and baking. In one month, this adds up to about 6.5 miles not driven.</p>
<br>
<h2>Drive 10 Miles Less</h2>

<p>In August, we took a more direct approach with our emissions and asked <u>what driving 10 miles <br/> less would mean for the planet.</u></p>
<p>This question brought us to one of my favorite findings of the year - if everyone that read that <br/> email when it was originally sent intentionally drove 10 miles less that week, it would have been <br/> like taking 1.5 cars off the road for an entire year - just from one group of EcoWarriors driving 10 <br/> miles less over the course of seven days</p>
<p>Individually, each person driving 10 miles less each week for one month would be the <br/> same as taking 0.0035 cars off the road for a full year.</p>
